I'm a software engineer with a focus on ES6 and TS. I enjoy participating in tech communities and meetups. Amateur speaker and blogger. 

I like to be polyglot and full-stack, and I am currently moving my first steps with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) 🧪. 

- 💻 **Languages I like:**: ES6, TypeScript, ReasonML, Elixir;
- 🗣 **Take a look at my presentations** on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/simonedavico). The latest one is [A Sip of Elixir](https://speakerdeck.com/simonedavico/a-sip-of-elixir).
- 📋 **Read my blog posts** on [Medium](https://medium.com/@simonedavico). The latest one is [Integrate XState with React Native and React Navigation](https://medium.com/welld-tech/integrate-xstate-with-react-native-and-react-navigation-21ead87391da).
- 🐦 **You can find me on** [twitter](https://twitter.com/simonedavico), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/simonedavico) or [ItaliaJS](https://italia-js.org/).
