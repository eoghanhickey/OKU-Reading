### Hi there 👋

<!--
**simonedavico/simonedavico** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software engineer with a focus on Elixir and ES6/TS. I enjoy participating in tech communities and meetups. Amateur speaker and blogger. 

I am a generalist at heart, and I am currently moving my first steps with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀. 

- 💻 **Languages I like:**: JS/TS, Elixir (and any other functions-as-first-class-citizen language);
- 🗣 **Take a look at my presentations** on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/simonedavico). The latest one is [A Sip of Elixir](https://speakerdeck.com/simonedavico/a-sip-of-elixir).
- 📋 **Read my blog posts** on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sdavico). The latest one is [Supercharging our event-sourcing capabilities with Phoenix LiveView](https://medium.com/casavo/supercharging-our-event-sourcing-capabilities-with-phoenix-liveview-c4a9d1d4ab99).
- 🐦 **You can find me on** [twitter](https://twitter.com/simonedavico), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/simonedavico) or [ItaliaJS](https://italia-js.org/).
